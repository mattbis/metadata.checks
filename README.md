# mvp.metadata.checks
a list of things I consider your mob/app or desktop/application must perform ...
1. Why bother taking the time to write a complex App to not adhere to the golden rule of decent programming: care about metadata.. Since the sole purpose of working with a format is to enable the sharing of the data. Otherwise: for where this is applicable it renders the said application pointless, despite its qualities in functionality. The world is constructed on metadata... TO not write it correctly is to abandon the entire point of all these millions of projects we are writing.
